  <h2 align="center">:star2: About the project</h2>
  <p>
    ToDoList is a CRUD application that allows the management of task lists. The user can add new lists, categories and cards that represent separate tasks. Each card      can be added to one of the categories and the user can edit each list, category and card.
  </p>
<p>
  In the application, it is also possible to add cards to a favourites list for quick access to the most important tasks. When adding a new card, the user can give it   a title and choose a customised icon from the font-awesome library. In addition, the app has a built-in search engine to easily find tasks.
</p>
<p>The project was built using React and Redux technologies, with SCSS-based styling.</p>
